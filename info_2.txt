Moreover, each race will have its own spread of
finish times. Two predictions having the 
same percent error at different races should be
interpreted differently; the better of the two 
is the one at the race where results are more
spread out. Additionally, result spread varies by 
gender. The following graph shows that MED and XGB exceed
the baseline accuracy of USU target times with respect 
to these measures as well.
