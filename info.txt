[UltraSignup](https://ultrasignup.com/), 
the leading marketplace and registration platform for
trail and ultra races in the United States, provides a target time
for participants when they register for a race. The platform also 
displays a runner rank for each participant who completes a
race. Both these numbers are generated by simple formulas
based on comparisons of participant times to winning times. 
(See below for further details.)

UltraSignup and I were intersted in what level of accuracy would be possible for
finish time predictions. This is a difficult problem, as ultra and trail 
racing are inherently high variance activites, due to factors such as tough 
terrain, the potential for bad weather, and long distances. 
UltraSignup provided me with a set of 1.4+ million results
from their database to test my models
against, using the USU target times as a baseline.

After a process of exploring, prototyping, rejecting, and revising,
I settled on two prediction methods. 
The first, MED, 
involves making simple modifications to the UltraSignup target time 
formula. It essentially replaces comparisons to minimum times
with comparisons to median times. The second, XGB, involves
engineering features and implementing an XGBoost tree-based
regression.

In evaluating prediction performance, it is 
important to be mindful of the heterogeneous nature of the data. 
Since race distances range from less than 1 mile to more than
100 miles, it would be possible for one prediction scheme to 
look good in the aggregate but to underperform on a certain stratum
of race distances. The following graph shows that MED and XGB exceed
the baseline accuracy of USU target times across the entire range of 
typical race distance categories.
