Ultrasignup, the leading marketplace and registration platform for
trail and ultra races in the United States, provides a target time
for participants when they register for a race. The platform also 
displays a runner rank for each participant who completes a
race. Both these numbers are generated by simple formulas
based on comparisons of participant times to winning times. 
(See below for further details.) Ultrasignup is clear that runner 
ranks and target times are to be understood simply as fun ways
to view performances. In particular, Ultrasignup does not 
frame the target times as finish time predictions.

I contacted Ultrasignup and pitched the idea of creating finish
time predictions. They liked it and put me in touch with their 
data scientist. We agreed to use the Ultrasignup target times
as a baseline to compare prediction accuracy against, and he sent me
a dataset of 1.4+ million results to work with.


After a lot of exploring, prototyping, rejecting, revising, 
and tuning, I settled on two prediction methods. 
The first, MED, 
involved making simple modifications to the Ultrasignup target time 
formula. It essentially replaces comparisons to minimum times
with comparisons to median times. The second, XGB, involved
engineering features and implementing an XGBoost
regression.


Both methods easily exceed the baseline accuracy of USU target 
times. This app shows the outcomes of the three schemes on
the portion of the dataset I reserved for testing.
(See below for further information about the dataset 
 and the test set.) **Note**: All time measurements in 
this app are in hours.


One last fun comment. Three of the 
most famous ultramarathons in the United States happened to 
appear in
the test set: Western States, Hardrock 100 Endurance Run, and
Badwater 135. I suggest checking those out first!
