MED is easy to implement and reliably generates
more realistic finish time predictions than USU.
My recommendation is to achieve quick incremental
improvement by implementing MED as soon as possible.

XGB requires more work and infrastructure to
implement. It also requires ongoing
maintenance in the form of performance monitoring
and periodic retraining. However, the potential 
benefits of implementing XGB are substantial. 
It outperforms MED across all race distances, with 
widening performance gaps at longer races and
significantly better predictions at the 
most famous races. Its accurate predictions 
can be publicized to bring new attention to the 
platform and leveraged by cross-functional teams
for such purposes as targeted and personalized 
advertising. My recommendation is to create a 
study of the costs required for implementing
XGB and to proceed with implementation when 
resources are available.
