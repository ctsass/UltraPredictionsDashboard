| Status (method) | Current baseline (comparisons to winning times) | New alternative 1 (comparisons to median times) | New alternative 2 (XGBoost regression) |
| Mean absolute error (error reduction relative to baseline) | 1.08 (N/A) | 0.85 (21%) | 0.76 (29%) |
| Implementation (timeline) | N/A (currently in production) | Simple changes to stored procedures (1 week) | More complex - model deployment in Python, performance monitoring (6-12 months) |
| Benefits | Familiarity | More realistic finish time predictions at all distances | Excels at long/famous events, publicity and advertising opportunities, capacity to add new features |
