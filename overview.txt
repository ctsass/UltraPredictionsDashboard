| Status  | Current baseline | New alternative 1 | New alternative 2 |
| Method   | Comparisons to winning times | Comparisons to median times | XGBoost machine learning regression algorithm |
| Mean absolute error (hours) | 1.08 | 0.85 | 0.76 |
| Error reduction relative to baseline | N/A | 21% | 29% |
| Implementation ease and timeline | N/A (currently in production) | Simple changes to stored procedures (1 week) | More complex - model deployment in Python, performance monitoring (6-12 months) |
| Benefits | Familiarity | More realistic finish time predictions at all distances | Excels at long/famous events, creating publicity and advertising opportunities |
