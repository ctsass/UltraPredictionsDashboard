| Status (method) | Current baseline (comparisons to winning times) | New alternative 1 (comparisons to median times) | New alternative 2 (XGBoost regression) |
| Mean absolute error (hours) | 1.08 | 0.85 | 0.76 |
| Error reduction relative to baseline | N/A | 21% | 29% |
| Implementation ease and timeline | N/A (currently in production) | Simple changes to stored procedures (1 week) | More complex - model deployment in Python, performance monitoring (6-12 months) |
| Benefits | Familiarity | More realistic finish time predictions at all distances | Excels at long/famous events, creating publicity and advertising opportunities |
