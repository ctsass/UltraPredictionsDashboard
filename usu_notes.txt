The following are from UltraSignup's FAQ page:
- Runner rank is simply an average of your past results in
our database. For each race, we take the gender specific 
best time (winner) and divide that time by each participant’s
time. The result is a value less than 100% with winners
receiving the full 100%. The average of the participant’s 
past races is their ranking.
- The target column is simply the average winning time
of an event over the past 4 years divided by your 
“Runner rank”. Like “Runner rank”, it is meant to be a fun
way to view your future performances. If you are not happy
with the target the computer gave you, use that as a 
motivator to prove it wrong. It is not perfect and is not 
meant to interfere with your actual running.
