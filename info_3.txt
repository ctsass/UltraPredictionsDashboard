The "Race-specific history" tab shows historical
winning and median times by gender. Winning times
are used by USU and median times are used by MED and
XGB.

It is notable that XGB performs quite well for 
Western States, by far the most famous
ultramarathon in the United States.
This is due to the machine learning algorithm 
having a significant amount of data for this race
because of the high number of participants
and their extensive previous experience. 
Other iconic races appearing in the 
test set include the Hardrock 100 Endurance Run and
Badwater 135.
