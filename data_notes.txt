- The original dataset contained 1,429,253 race results with
dates ranging from 08-24-2018 to 08-05-2023.
- After removing probable non-running races, 
there were 1,191,678 results in the filtered dataset.
- In order to engineer features to be used for predictions, 
two pieces of information were needed:
at least one earlier result for the participant and the 
results from at least one previous running of the race.
- So a large portion of the filtered dataset could only be
used to engineer features for examples occurring later
(by date) in the filtered dataset.
- The final engineered dataset contained 459,433 examples 
with features for predictions.
- This dataset was split by date into training and test sets
in order to train and evaluate an XGBoost algorithm 
for predicting finish times.
- The train set contained 419,861 examples, with dates 
ranging from 02-17-2019 to 04-30-2023.
- The test set contained 39,572 examples, with dates 
ranging from 05-01-2023 to 08-05-2023.
- This app contains information about the performance of 
USU targets and the two prediction schemes on the test set.
